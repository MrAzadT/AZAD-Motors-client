            Hyundai Creta facelift launched globally – All you need to know
          </h1>
          <h2 className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500">Azad, 11 November 2021</h2>

          <p className="mt-6">
            The new Hyundai Creta is here! Well, not in India but Hyundai has
            just launched the facelift of the current-generation Creta for the
            Indonesian market. It is not long before the new Creta was
            introduced and so Hyundai has kept the changes subtle rather than
            going all out with an all-new model.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            This being a facelift, the updates on the Creta are mainly cosmetic
            in nature. Up front, the SUV gets the Tucson-derived
            ‘parametric-jewel’ design for the massive grille with integrated
            DRLs. The LED headlamp units are housed further down in the bumper
            while the silver accents in the centre are new and add a tinge of
            contrasting effect.
          </p>
          <p className=" mt-4">
            While the side profile remains unaltered, the posterior gets the
            re-positioned stop lamp that is now roof-mounted leaving a sharp
            crease line on the boot lid. The design for the LED tail lamps has
            also been tweaked. Overall, the refreshed Creta has a distinct and
            modern look over the outgoing model which was not to everybody’s
            liking when launched last year.
          </p>
          <p className=" mt-4">
            While the overall design and layout of the cabin remain the same,
            it’s the feature list that has become more extensive. It’s now
            loaded with features like an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment
            system, air purifier, Bose stereo system, Bluelink connected car
            tech, front ventilated seats, a panoramic sunroof, and ambient
            lighting. While the India-spec model is equipped with these, what’s
            new is the 10.25-inch fully digital instrument cluster from the
            recently launched Alcazar that displays a host of data and different
            display modes.

            MG Motor India inaugurates its first residential community charger
            in Gurugram
          </h1>
          <h2 className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500">Azad, 12 November 2021</h2>

          <p className="mt-6">
            MG Motor India inaugurated the first residential community charger
            in Gurugram with chargers installed at The WorldSpa condominiums. To
            enable this, MG has collaborated with Electreefi and the
            condominium’s RWA to offer charger access to all EV owners and
            drivers, including WorldSpa residents and visitors.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Along with its partners and other RWAs, MG will continue to bolster
            the community charger infrastructure in the future. In doing so, the
            carmaker aims to allow a hassle-free vehicle charging experience
            across several residential spaces to promote EV adoption. With the
            launch of residential community chargers, MG Motor India is adding

            six-step charging ecosystem will promote the adoption of cleaner and
            greener mobility in India.

            Furthermore, to enable an EV ecosystem in the country, the carmaker
            has partnered with Fortum and Tata Power to introduce superfast
            charging stations. Apart from this, the MG ZS EV comes with an AC
            fast-charger (installed at the customer’s home/office), a
            plug-and-charge cable onboard, as well as a charge-on-the-go with
            RSA (Road Side Assistance). We have driven the ZS EV and you can
